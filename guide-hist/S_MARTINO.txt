CHURCH AND MONASTERY OF S. MARTINO. 
Open from 9 till 5; entrance, 1 lira each. To save time, the carriage can be told to return and wait at the foot of the descent, which can be best made on foot. Formerly belonging to the Carthusians, but now to the government. Com. Fiorelli has recently collected within its walls a museum of majolicas, tapestry, glasses, mirrors, etc. For its decorations and richness the church is unsurpassed. Twelve different roses of Egyptian granite, a mosaic pavement, a high altar, and paintings render it superb. The vault has a painting of the Ascension, with the twelve apostles between the entrance (the Descent from the Cross is by Stanzioni); an unfinished Nativity by Guido Reni, who died whilst at work on the subject. In the tesoro of the sacristy is Spagnoletto's masterpiece, the Descent from the Cross. The Judith on its vault, by Giordano, is said to have been painted in forty-eight hours when he was seventy-two years old. Grand views from the belvedere.
