THE THREE LAW-COURTS, OR "CURIAE" Excavated 1819. Reg. III. Ins. II. 
Visitors are advised not to omit noting the fine brick - work construction of these three Law-Courts. This beautiful building was probably used for Tribunals, or for administrative purposes. Its walls were apparently covered with white marble. STREET OF ABUNDANCE. Excavated 1813-1858. Visitors may walk through the "Strada della Abbondanza", which owes its name to a fountain standing outside the small entry of the temple of the priestess Eumachia. This street, like the others, is paved with large pieces of volcanic stone, cut in polygonal form. It is one of the principal streets in the city, and is flanked by several shops and houses. Instead of numbers for the houses and shops, the Pompeians painted letters in black or red to indicate the name of the proprietor, whilst the names of the streets were probably indicated by signs. Note. Visitors will remember that Arbaces simulating wisdom, honesty, and modesty, induced lone to pay him a visit. lone, unconscious of the danger, and of all the mysterious intrigues of that evil house, innocently accepted the invitation.
