USEFUL HINTS. 

On arrival, look sharply after your personal luggage, and get as quickly as possible into the omnibus of the hotel you have selected; then give the ticket of your registered baggage to the hotel porter, who will get it without your troubling. If you take a cab to the hotel, refuse to proceed if a stranger mounts the box. "Have him down!" or you will have to pay a commission. Pay no attention to touters at the railway. Take lunch in the middle of the day. If you get into a heat, do not go into the shade or into a building till you have cooled down. On inhaling a bad odour, if the stomach is empty, take a nip of brandy, medicinally. Do not over-fatigue yourself.
