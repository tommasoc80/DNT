Capri
From Capri town a visit may be made to Anacapri, 2 1/2 miles, by a road cut in the rock, commanding beautiful views, the second town of the island; pop., 2,500. There are Roman ruins in the neighbourhood. [Hotels, see p. iii.] From Anacapri good walkers should make the ascent of Monte Salaro (1,920), on the south side of the island, rising abruptly from the sea. The view, or, rather, two views from the summit are superb, taking in the Bay and suburbs of Naples, with the Apennines, Vesuvius, Salerno, Prestum, Sorrento, etc., on one side, and the long land and sea view to Calabria. The greatest attraction of all is a visit to the Blue Grotto (Grotta Azzurra). This is made from the steamer in small boats, by travellers who are not making a stay on shore. Fare to the Grotto and back, 1 1/4 fr. For resident visitors on the island a boat may be hired at the Marina Grande, changing into a smaller boat at the Grotto. Time required, 2 hours â€” a most delightful excursion along the rocky shore. This natural curiosity is alone worth the journey to the island. It can only, however, be entered when the sea is calm, and even then the visitor must bend his head low in the boat, as the low rocky arch is entered. On rising, he finds himself in fairyland. "The walls and roof are all radiant with precious stones of a clear, rich blue, not seen to perfection until nearly half an hour has passed, but every moment becoming more radiant." The hand, or any object, placed in the water seems as if silvered over. "Throw a stone into the water," says a writer, "and a myriad of tiny bubbles that are created flash out a brilliant glare like blue theatrical fires. Dip an oar and its blade turns to a splendid, frosted silver, tinted with blue. Let a man jump in, and he is instantly cased in an armour more gorgeous than ever knightly Crusader wore." An official tariff fixes the charges for boats and admission to Grotto, but gratuities are expected.
