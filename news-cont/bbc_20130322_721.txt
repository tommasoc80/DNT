  Russian police and tax inspectors have raided the offices of the human rights group Memorial and other civil society groups which get foreign funding. Memorial is famous for documenting human rights abuses in Russia. The US embassy in Moscow has voiced concern and asked the Russian government for an explanation. A new Russian law says foreign-funded non-governmental groups -LRB- NGOs -RRB- linked to politics must register as ``foreign agents'' - a term which suggests spying. In the worst repressions of the Soviet period the label ``foreign agents'' was used to denounce dissidents - or simply political rivals of Joseph Stalin - and could lead to execution. Memorial says inspectors returned to its Moscow offices on Friday, having already seized 600 documents including accounts on Thursday. A statement on the Memorial website said the inspections were directly linked to the new law on NGOs and the targeted groups ' compliance with it. Memorial director Arseny Roginsky, quoted by the Russian news website Vesti, said it was ``a complete check on everything concerned with our sources of funding''. He insisted that the NGO law ``will not change our position at all''. ``We wo n't refuse foreign donations, nor will we register as a ` foreign agent ','' he said.
