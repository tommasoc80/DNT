Population In 2015, the population of the city of Naples was 975,000, though Greater Naples' population was much higher at 3.1 million. This makes the Naples Metropolitan Area the third most populous in all of Italy after Rome and Milan. Historically, Naples grew from 621,000 in 1901 to 1.2 million in 1971 but then declined to its current number as many city residents began to move out into the suburbs. Naples is the most densely populated metropolis in Italy, having over 8,000 people per square kilometer. Ethnicity Unlike many of the cities in Italy's northern region, Naples' population is almost entirely Italian (98.5%) since there are very few foreign immigrants present. In 2006, a survey found less than 20,000 foreigners in the city, and their most common countries/regions of origin were as follows: Ukraine, Poland various other Eastern European nations, Sri Lanka and East Asia. Interestingly, most immigrants to Naples are female because the majority of male immigrants gravitate toward northern Italy where they find higher-paying jobs. Demographics Some significant demographic figures that help to characterize the city of Naples include: 19% of residents are under 14 years old, compared to 14% in Italy generally. Only 13% are over 65, compared to 19% nationally. Thus, Naples is generally a "young city." Naples has significantly more females than males: 52.5% as opposed to 47.5%. Naples has a relatively high birth rate at 10.5 per 1,000. The birth rate in Italy as a whole is 9.5 per 1,000. Occupations In the past, Naples was a center of agriculture-based industries but has recently converted to a service-oriented employment structure. In 2003, a survey of the Neapolitan Province found the following jobs-breakdown: 31% public services, 18% manufacturing, 14% trade, 9.5% construction, eight percent transport and seven percent finances. A 2002 survey found a quarter million businesses, but only 15 with 500 workers or more and just 70 with over 200. Economy The people of Naples enjoy a per capita GDP of $ 18,749, which is the fourth-best in Italy as to purchasing power. Although unemployment, corrupt politicians and organized crime have haunted the city for decades, Naples has managed to see significant economic progress in spite of these problems. One of the main sources of Naples' economic importance is the Port of Naples, which is one of the largest and busiest in the Mediterranean Sea. A second major driver of the local economy is tourism. Naples has been a major tourist destination since the 1700's and is today sees hundreds of thousands of people visiting the city's landmarks and enjoying its warm, Mediterranean climate every year.
