Districts 
Naples used to be divided into 30 quartieri (neighbourhoods), however today these neighbourhoods do n't hold much administrative use but are still used by locals to refer to parts of the city. Nowadays the city is divided into 10 municipalities. However this page will divide Naples into 5 districts and regions on the point of view of the traveller.
