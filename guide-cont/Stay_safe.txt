Stay safe 
In some circles, Naples has acquired a reputation as being a particularly dangerous city, yet in reality, it is about as safe as other major urban centers. There are many parts of town that are generally very safe, and there are other areas that, under certain circumstances, can be somewhat dangerous. Besides avoiding dangerous areas and situations, you will also need to exercise some general precautions regardless of the time/place, including: Wear a money belt or otherwise conceal your cash, credit cards, personal ID and important travel papers. Even if you carry a purse or handbag, do not store your most valuable items in it. Watch for pickpockets and do not "flash around" expensive jewelry, watches, electronics and the like. Be alert to fraud and scams, which sometimes are attempted on tourists at the markets or while walking the streets. Most stalls and salesmen will be valid, but if something seems suspicious, it's better to play it safe. Watch the meter when riding in taxis and be sure you clearly establish your desired destination and remind the driver to take the fastest route. Watch for reckless drivers, mostly of motorcycles and scooters while walking the town. Sometimes, they zoom through the city's narrow streets dangerously close to crowds of pedestrians or suddenly appear around sharp corners. Pay a little extra for comprehensive insurance coverage on any vehicles you rent while in Naples. Make sure wheels and tires are included in the coverage since pot holes and generally poor conditions will be found on many streets. Park in secure parking zones rather than along the streets wherever possible. Parking zones are plentiful and cheap, so there is no need to risk a car theft or vandalizing.
