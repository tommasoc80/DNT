# DNT
Diachronic News and Travel (DNT) corpus.

This corpus contains 279 documents, for a total of 183.517 tokens, distributed across three genres (news, travel reports, and travel guides) and two temporal periods (1862-1939 and 1998-2017).

This repository contains the raw text data divided per genre and temporal period (e.g. guide-hist: folder with travel guide from the 1862-1939 period).

The data have been enriched with manual annotation and accompanied by the development of NPL processing tools. We aim at making DNT a large multi-layer annotated corpus with different language phenomena. Feel free to contribute!
