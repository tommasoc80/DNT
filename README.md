# DNT
Diachronic News and Travel (DNT) corpus.

This corpus contains 279 documents, for a total of 183.517 tokens, distributed across three genres (news, travel reports, and travel guides) and two temporal periods (1862-1939 and 1998-2017).

This repository contains the raw text data divided per genre and temporal period (e.g. guide-hist: folder with travel guide from the 1862-1939 period).

The data have been enriched with manual annotation and accompanied by the development of NPL processing tools. We aim at making DNT a large multi-layer annotated corpus with different language phenomena. Feel free to contribute!

Below we link the dedicated repositories for each task:

- Content Types Identification: https://github.com/tommasoc80/ContentTypes

- Event Detection in Historical Texts: https://github.com/dhfbk/Histo

- Named Entity Recognition in Historical Texts:  https://github.com/dhfbk/Detection-of-place-names-in-historical-travel-writings 

DNT will be presented to the 10th AIUCD conference *[DH for society: e-quality, participation, rights and values in the Digital Age.]*(http://www.aiucd.it/convegno-aiucd-2021/)


*COMING SOON*: pre-tokenized version of the data with offsets.
