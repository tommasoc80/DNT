<s> <s> Hong Kong and Its People </s>
<s> <s> Exciting , mysterious , glamorous — these words have described Hong Kong for at least a century . </s>
<s> <s> With its vibrant atmosphere and night-and-day activity it is an intoxicating place . </s>
<s> <s> Hong Kong is crowded — it has one of the world ’s greatest population densities . </s>
<s> <s> But it is also efficient , with one of the best transportation systems anywhere , and for such a crowded place , quiet — you do n’t hear voices raised in anger , motorists sitting on their horns , or loud boomboxes . </s>
<s> <s> Shopping never ends — there ’s always another inviting spot just down the street . </s>
<s> <s> You ’ll find Hong Kong easy to get around , the people helpful , English spoken everywhere , and food that lives up to its reputation . </s>
<s> <s> On 1 July , 1997 the British Crown Colony of Hong Kong reverted to Chinese sovereignty as a Special Administrative Region of the People ’s Republic of China . </s>
<s> <s> Today Hong Kong remains a capitalist enclave with its laws and rights intact , and China has promised that Hong Kong will continue in this fashion for at least 50 years . </s>
<s> <s> Beijing ’s announced policy of maintaining Hong Kong ’s prosperity and stability makes sense . </s>
<s> <s> Hong Kong has long been China ’s handiest window on the West , and the city is unrivaled in its commercial know-how and managerial expertise . </s>
<s> <s> Around the time of the transition there was much speculation about how things would change . </s>
<s> <s> But in fact , once news of the handover vanished from the front pages , the people of Hong Kong returned to their usual topics of conversation : the economy and the price of housing . </s>
<s> <s> The impression of the visitor today will be that very little has changed . </s>
<s> <s> Establishments are no longer called “ Royal , ” Queen Elizabeth has vanished from the coinage , and the Union Jack has been replaced by the flag of China and the new Hong Kong flag with its bauhinia flower . </s>
<s> <s> But in fact , there have been changes , many of them due to economic progress , new construction , and other factors that influence cities all over the world . </s>
<s> <s> Others are more subtle . </s>
<s> <s> British social customs are still evident in the kind of polite service you get in hotels and in the long lines of people waiting for buses at rush hour . </s>
<s> <s> The British population has decreased ; today there are as many American and Australian ex-pats as there are British . </s>
<s> <s> With a population of nearly eight million and a total area of just over 1,095 square km ( 423 square miles ) , housing is one of Hong Kong ’s perennial nightmares . </s>
<s> <s> To alleviate the problem , the government has become the city ’s major landlord with the construction of massive apartment blocks that , though they have every modern facility , average only 9 square m ( 100 square ft ) in size . </s>
<s> <s> Whole cities have been created in the New Territories , although the unimaginative architecture of these towns has been criticized . </s>
<s> <s> Of Hong Kong ’s population , 98 percent are Chinese . </s>
<s> <s> The majority are Cantonese , born in Hong Kong , or from South China , but there are immigrants from all over China . </s>
<s> <s> The Chinese people have been described as hardworking and pragmatic , attitudes that have contributed to Hong Kong ’s success . </s>
<s> <s> There are many stories of refugees who arrived with nothing in their pockets , set up a small sidewalk stall , worked diligently until they had their own store , and then expanded it into a modest chain . </s>
<s> <s> Old customs are still followed : Fate and luck are taken very seriously , and astrologers and fortune-tellers do a steady business . </s>
<s> <s> Before a skyscraper can be built , a feng shui ( see page 68 ) investigation must take place to ensure that the site and the building will promote health , harmony , and prosperity . </s>
<s> <s> You ’ll also notice that gambling is a passion , whether it be cards , mah-jong , the lottery , or the horses . </s>
<s> <s> Hong Kong has two major racetracks as well as an intensive off-track betting system , and on weekends the ferries to Macau are crowded with people on their way to the casinos . </s>
<s> <s> Sightseeing in Hong Kong starts at sea level with the enthralling water traffic — a mix of freighters , ferries , tugs , junks , and yachts . </s>
<s> <s> Views of the city and the harbor are panoramic . </s>
<s> <s> From Victoria Peak , Hong Kong ’s highest point , or from skyscrapers and hotels , they are especially exciting at night when the lights are on . </s>
<s> <s> The business and financial center and the signature soaring architecture are on Hong Kong Island . </s>
<s> <s> Across Victoria Harbor , connected by ferry and the MTR rail line , is the Kowloon peninsula with its hotels , nightlife , and almost non-stop shopping . </s>
<s> <s> Beyond , in the New Territories , are a mixture of high-rise suburban towns , ancient sites and walled villages , country parks , and farms with ducks and fish ponds . </s>
<s> <s> Hong Kong ’s other , less developed islands , Lantau , Lamma , and Cheung Chau , provide getaways . </s>
<s> <s> You can also take a ferry to Macau to find an entirely different kind of city , a unique blend of Chinese and Iberian culture . </s>
<s> <s> It ’s anyone ’s guess what may happen in the future , but for now Hong Kong bristles with energy and ambition , and for the visitor , this beautiful city with its contrasts and variety is an exhilarating experience . </s>
