<s> <s> CHAPTER II - OF ITALIAN MEN AND MANNERS </s>
<s> <s> The Italian peasant does n’t live so badly as many think , though true it is that meat is rare enough on his table . </s>
<s> <s> He eats something more than a greasy rag and an olive , as the well-fed Briton would have us believe ; and something more than macaroni , as the American fondly thinks . </s>
<s> <s> For one thing , he has his eternal minestra , a good , thick soup of many things which Anglo-Saxons would hardly know how to turn into as wholesome and nourishing a broth ; meat of any kind , always what the French call pate d’Italie , and herbs of the field . </s>
<s> <s> The macaroni , the olives , the cheese and the wine — always the wine — come after . </s>
<s> <s> Not bad that ; considerably better than corned beef and pie , and far , far better than boiled mutton and cauliflower as a steady diet ! </s>
<s> <s> Britons and Americans should wake up and learn something about gastronomy . </s>
<s> <s> The general expenses of middle-class domestic town life in Italy are lower than in most other countries , and the necessities for outlay are smaller . </s>
<s> <s> The Italian , even comfortably off in the working class , is less inclined to spend money on luxurious trivialities than most of us . </s>
<s> <s> He prefers to save or invest his surplus . </s>
<s> <s> One takes central Italy as typical because , if it is not the most prosperous , considered from an industrial point of view , it is still the region endowed with the greatest natural wealth . </s>
<s> <s> By this is meant that the conditions of life are there the easiest and most comfortable . </s>
<s> <s> A middle class town family with an income of six or seven thousand lire spends very little on rent to begin with ; pretence based upon the size of the front door knob cuts no figure in the Italian code of pride . </s>
<s> <s> This family will live in a flat , not in a villini as separate town houses are called . </s>
<s> <s> One sixth of the family income will go for rent , and though the apartment may be bare and grim and lack actual luxury it will possess amplitude , ten or twelve rooms , and be near the centre of the town . </s>
<s> <s> This applies in the smaller cities of from twenty to fifty thousand inhabitants . </s>
<s> <s> With very little modification the same will apply in Rome or Naples , and , with perhaps none at all , at Florence . </s>
<s> <s> The all important servant question would seem to be more easily solved in Italy than elsewhere , but it is commonly the custom to treat Italian servants as one of the family — so far as certain intimacies and affections go — though , perhaps this of itself has some unanticipated objections . </s>
<s> <s> The Italian servants have the reputation of becoming like feudal retainers ; that is , they “ stay on the job , ” and from eight to twenty-five lire a month pays their wages . </s>
<s> <s> In reality they become almost personal or body servants , for in few Italian cities , and certainly not in Italian towns , are they obliged to occupy themselves with the slogging work of the London slavey , or the New York chore-woman . </s>
<s> <s> An Italian servant , be she young or old , however , has a seeming disregard for a uniform or badge of servitude , and is often rather sloppy in appearance . </s>
<s> <s> She is , for that , all the more picturesque since , if untidy , she is not apt to be loathsomely dirty in her apparel or her manner of working . </s>
<s> <s> The Italian of all ranks is content with two meals a day , as indeed we all ought to be . </s>
<s> <s> The continental morning coffee and roll , or more likely a sweet cake , is universal here , though sometimes the roll is omitted . </s>
<s> <s> Lunch is comparatively a light meal , and dinner at six or seven is simply an amplified lunch . </s>
<s> <s> The chianti of Tuscany is the usual wine drunk at all meals , or a substitute for it less good , though all red wine in Italy seems to be good , cheap and pure . </s>
<s> <s> Adulteration is apparently too costly a process . </s>
<s> <s> Wine and biscuits take the place of afternoon tea — and with advantage . </s>
<s> <s> The wine com monly used en famille is seldom bought at more than 1.50 lira the flagon of two and a half litres , and can be had for half that price . </s>
<s> <s> Sugar and salt are heavily taxed , and though that may be a small matter with regard to salt it is something of an item with sugar . </s>
<s> <s> Wood is almost entirely the fuel for cooking and heating , and the latter is very inefficient coming often from simple braziers or scaldini filled with embers and set about where they are supposed to do the most good . </s>
<s> <s> If one does not expire from the cold before the last spark has departed from the already dying embers when they are brought in , he orders another and keeps it warm by enveloping it as much as possible with his person . </s>
<s> <s> Italian heating arrangements are certainly more economical than those in Britain , but are even less efficient , as most of the caloric value of wood and coal goes up the chimney with the smoke . </s>
<s> <s> The American system of steam heat — on the “ chauffage centrale ” plan — will some day strike Europe , and then the householder will buy his heat on the water , gas and electric light plan . </s>
<s> <s> Till then southern Europe will freeze in winter . </s>
<s> <s> In Rome and Florence it is a very difficult proceeding to be able to control enough heat — by any means whatever — to properly warm an apartment in winter . </s>
<s> <s> If the apartment has no chimney , and many have n’t in the living rooms , one perforce falls back again on the classic scaldini placed in the middle of the room and fired up with charcoal . </s>
<s> <s> Then you huddle around it like Indians in a wigwam and , if you do n’t take a short route into eternity by asphyxiation , your extremities ultimately begin to warm up ; when they begin to get chilly again you recommence the firing up . </s>
<s> <s> This is more than difficult ; it is inconvenient and annoying . </s>
