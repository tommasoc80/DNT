<s> <s> We don't know who is winning the drug war in Latin America , but we know who's losing it - - the press . </s>
<s> <s> Over the past six months , six journalists have been killed and 10 kidnapped by drug traffickers or leftist guerrillas - - who often are one and the same - - in Colombia . </s>
<s> <s> Over the past 12 years , at least 40 journalists have died there . </s>
<s> <s> The attacks have intensified since the Colombian government began cracking down on the traffickers in August , trying to prevent their takeover of the country . </s>
<s> <s> The slaughter in Colombia was very much on the minds of 450 editors and publishers from Latin America , the United States , the Caribbean and Canada attending the 45th general assembly of the Inter - American Press Association in Monterrey , Mexico , this week . </s>
<s> <s> On Tuesday the conference got word of another atrocity , the assassination in Medellin of two employees of El Espectador , Colombia's second - largest newspaper . </s>
<s> <s> The paper's local administrator , Maria Luz Lopez , was shot dead , and her mother wounded , while her car was stopped for a red light . </s>
<s> <s> An hour later , the paper's circulation manager , Miguel Soler , was shot and killed near his home . </s>
<s> <s> The drug lords who claimed responsibility said they would blow up the Bogota newspaper's offices if it continued to distribute in Medellin . </s>
<s> <s> They bombed the Bogota offices last month , destroying its computer and causing $2 . 5 million in damage . </s>
<s> <s> El Espectador has been a special target because of the extraordinary courage of its publisher and his staff . </s>
<s> <s> At Monterrey , publisher Luis Gabriel Cano , although shaken by the murders , issued a statement saying : "We will not cease our fight against drug trafficking . </s>
<s> <s> They want to terrify the press and in particular El Espectador because it has always been a torchbearer in this war . " </s>
<s> <s> This comes from a man whose brother , Guillermo , was murdered in 1986 . </s>
<s> <s> The publishers in Monterrey command no battalions , but they agreed to express their outrage with editorials in today's editions . </s>
<s> <s> Many will use a common editorial . </s>
<s> <s> A final statement yesterday said : "While some advances are being made in nations throughout the hemisphere , the state of press freedom in the Americas still must be regarded as grim as long as journalists and their families are subject to the crudest form of censorship : death by assassination . " </s>
<s> <s> The report charged that Panama's Manuel Noriega is not only in league with the drug traffickers but also is bullying the press as never before . </s>
<s> <s> "Noriega has closed every independent newspaper , radio and television station and arrested , tortured or forced into exile a long list of reporters , " the statement declared . </s>
<s> <s> It added : "In Cuba , public enemy No . 1 of press freedoms in the hemisphere , repression of journalists both Cuban and foreign is worse than ever . " </s>
<s> <s> And in Nicaragua , promises of press freedom by the Sandinistas "have not materialized . " </s>
<s> <s> As it happens , the four countries cited , Colombia , Cuba , Panama and Nicaragua , are not only where the press is under greatest attack but also are linked by the drug trade and left - wing politics . </s>
<s> <s> Noriega is close to Castro and may once have been his agent . </s>
<s> <s> Sandinistas Thomas Borge and the Ortega brothers are Castro proteges ; he backed their takeover of Nicaragua . </s>
<s> <s> In Colombia , the drug - financed guerrillas trying to seize the country and destroy democracy include M - 19 , which Castro has clearly backed . </s>
<s> <s> Robert Merkel , a former U . S . attorney handling drug indictments in Florida , doesn't think for a minute that Castro's much publicized trials of high officials engaged in the drug trade mean he has broken off with the Medellin drug cartel . </s>
<s> <s> "If the cartel succeeds in blackmailing the Colombian authorities into negotiations , the cartel will be in control and Fidel can exploit his past relationships with them , " he told the Journal's David Asman recently . </s>
<s> <s> The struggle against the drug lords in Colombia will be a near thing . </s>
<s> <s> This week , the government arrested Jose Abello Silva , said to be the fourth - ranking cartel leader . </s>
<s> <s> He will probably be extradited to the U . S . for trial under an extradition treaty President Virgilia Barco has revived . </s>
<s> <s> Later , another high - ranking trafficker , Leonidas Vargas , was arrested and 1 , 000 pounds of dynamite seized . </s>
<s> <s> Mr . Barco has refused U . S . troops or advisers but has accepted U . S . military aid . </s>
<s> <s> President Bush has agreed to meet within 90 days with Mr . Barco , President Alan Garcia of Peru and President Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia to discuss the drug problem . </s>
<s> <s> It might not be a bad idea to do that sooner , rather than later . </s>
<s> <s> After the Panama fiasco , they will need some reassurance . </s>
<s> <s> Certainly , the Colombian press is much in need of that . </s>
