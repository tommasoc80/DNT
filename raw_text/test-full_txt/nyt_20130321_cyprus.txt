<s> <s> A Cyprus exit from the euro union , if it comes to that , would have a devastating effect on the country 's citizens , who are among the most indebted in the euro zone . </s>
<s> <s> And for European unity and diplomacy , the Cyprus debacle has already been at least a short-term disaster . </s>
<s> <s> ut for the broader financial system in Europe , the losses resulting from a Cypriot banking collapse and the country 's return to its former currency would be minimal compared with the havoc that Greece would have created had it not been bailed out . </s>
<s> <s> And that , economists and investors contend , is why Germany and its Dutch stalking horse , Jeroen Dijsselbloem , the president of the Eurogroup of finance ministers , were so adamant that depositors - large and small , Cypriot and Russian - contribute 5.8 billion euros -LRB- $ 7.5 billion -RRB- toward the 10 billion euro bailout of Cyprus 's largest banks . </s>
<s> <s> Greece may well have been too big to fail last year , but Cyprus , which creates less than one-half percent of the euro zone 's gross domestic product , is certainly not . </s>
<s> <s> From a financial standpoint , what is most noteworthy is that the combined debt of the Cypriot people , companies and government is 2.6 times the size of the country 's gross domestic product . </s>
<s> <s> Only Ireland , still struggling to recover from the banking collapse that required an international bailout in 2010 , has a higher debt-to-G.D.P. ratio among euro zone countries . </s>
<s> <s> As debts in Europe mount in inverse proportion to the ability of its citizens , companies and governments to make good on them , the view is forming in Berlin and Brussels that a signal must be sent that citizens and investors must start accepting losses for the euro zone to survive in the long run . </s>
<s> <s> `` There have been too many bailouts in Europe ; it 's time to remove the air bags , '' said Stephen Jen , a former economist at the International Monetary Fund who runs a hedge fund in London . </s>
<s> <s> `` This is not a Lehman , '' he said , referring to the disastrous chain reaction touched off by the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 . </s>
<s> <s> Eric Dor is a French economist who has studied the mechanics of how a country might remove itself from the monetary union . </s>
<s> <s> By his calculations , the euro zone - through its central banking system and its national banks - has just 27 billion euros in outstanding credit exposure to Cyprus . </s>
<s> <s> That is a mere rounding error compared with the euro zone G.D.P. of 9.4 trillion euros . </s>
<s> <s> Estimates of the potential cost if Greece had been forced into a disorderly euro exit have ranged from 200 billion euros to 800 billion euros , given the larger exposure that the European Central Bank and European banks had to the country . </s>
<s> <s> `` This explains why Germany and others are putting so much pressure on Cyprus , '' said Mr. Dor , head of research at the Ieseg School of Management in Lille , France . </s>
<s> <s> `` They are saying we can take the risk of pushing Cyprus out of the euro zone , and that Europe can take the losses without going broke . '' </s>
<s> <s> Mr. Dor notes that the current euro zonewide system of insuring bank deposits up to 100,000 euros was put in place after the financial panic that followed the Lehman collapse . </s>
<s> <s> Those deposits are supposed to be insured by national governments . </s>
<s> <s> So when the president of Cyprus admitted this week that his country did not have the money to backstop the 30 billion euros of guaranteed bank deposits - a figure greater than the Cypriot economy itself - a crucial bond of trust between a government and its citizens was snapped . </s>
<s> <s> `` It is the first time ever that the leader of a euro zone country has admitted that he could not afford to pay the guarantee , '' Mr. Dor said . </s>
<s> <s> A hasty expulsion from the euro zone would make the savings of the Cypriot people all the more evanescent , once they are converted back into Cypriot pounds , the currency Cyprus used before adopting the euro in 2007 . </s>
