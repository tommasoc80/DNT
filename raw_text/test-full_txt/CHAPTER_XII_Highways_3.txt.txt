<s> <s> THE BEAUTIFUL BAY OF NAPLES </s>
<s> <s> Pompeii is remarkable , but it is disappointing . </s>
<s> <s> All that is of real interest has been removed to the Naples museum . </s>
<s> <s> Without its Forum and its magnificent temples and Vesuvius as a toile de fond Pompeii would be a dreary place indeed to any but an archæologist . </s>
<s> <s> It is a waste of time to view any restored historic monument where modern house painters have refurbished the old half-obliterated frescoes . </s>
<s> <s> The famous Cave Canem , too , the only mosaic that remains intact , has been twice removed from its original emplacement . </s>
<s> <s> Yes , Pompeii is a disappointment ! </s>
<s> <s> It is too much of a show-place ! </s>
<s> <s> The most notable observation to be made with regard to the admirable architectural details of Pompeii is that they are all on a diminutive scale . </s>
<s> <s> The colonnade of the Forum , for instance , could never be carried out on the magnificent scale of the Roman Forum , and indeed , when modern architects have attempted to reproduce the façade of a tiny pagan temple , as in the Église de la Madeleine , or the Palais Bourbon at Paris , they have failed miserably . </s>
<s> <s> The rival claims of the Hotel Suisse and the Hotel Diomede at Pompeii ( to say nothing of that of the Albergo del Sol opposite the entrance to the Amphitheatre ) make it difficult for the stranger to decide upon which to bestow his patronage . </s>
<s> <s> The artists go to the Albergo del Sol , which is rough and uncomfortable enough from many points of view , and the tourists of convention go to one of the other two , where they are “ exploited ” a bit but get more attention . </s>
<s> <s> At any one of these hotels one can hire a horse to climb up the cone of Vesuvius , if one thinks he would like such rude sport , and prices are anything he will pay , about five or six francs , though it costs another two francs for a guide and another two francs for the ragamuffin who follows after and holds the horses while you explore the crater . </s>
<s> <s> If the latter was blacking boots in New York , even for a padrone , at five cents a shine , he would make more money and be counted out of the robber class . </s>
<s> <s> As it is he is a rank impostor and needless — provided you have the courage to refuse his services . </s>
<s> <s> The contrast between Herculaneum and Pompeii is notable . </s>
<s> <s> Herculaneum was buried under thirty metres of liquid lava , but Pompeii was buried only roof-high under cinders . </s>
<s> <s> Herculaneum will some day be uncovered to the extent of Pompeii , and then it is probable the world will have new marvels at which to wonder . </s>
<s> <s> The rewards from the excavation of Herculaneum may well be commensurate with the toil . </s>
<s> <s> It was an infinitely more important place than Pompeii , which was only a little country town without libraries or particularly wealthy inhabitants . </s>
<s> <s> Herculaneum , on the other hand , was the summer resort of wealthy Romans , who spent their lives in adorning their beautiful villas with the choicest work of Greek art . </s>
<s> <s> Pliny said that they had a mania for collecting Greek silver and other works of art , and at prices that would even make the wealthiest art connoisseurs of to-day pause for thought . </s>
<s> <s> Agrippina , among others , had her villa here . </s>
<s> <s> Herculaneum remains intact and undespoiled , as it was more than eighteen centuries ago . </s>
