<s> <s> Day 270 Friday 14th October 2016 – Naples </s>
<s> <s> Breakfast on the roof terrace , it is overcast but no rain so it was lovely sitting there having our strong Italian coffee , fresh fruit and homemade cake . </s>
<s> <s> Today is museum day so up the road we headed jumping out of the way of scooters , prams and piles of rubbish . </s>
<s> <s> Naples still has a huge rubbish problem and there have been many controversies over the years including the mafia connections but currently it is probably better . </s>
<s> <s> We made our way to the Museo Cappella Sansevero this chapel has one of the world’s most incredible marble statues , the Cristo velato ( The veiled Christ ) by Giuseppe Sanmarino in 1753 . </s>
<s> <s> Sorry no photos but if you are in Naples please see this piece unbelievably there are no lines although tour groups did come and go . </s>
<s> <s> After looking at the statue for a few minutes I started to forget it was marble and had an eerie feeling I was looking at a corpse with a thin veil covering it , you can see the indents of where the nails had been , the vein in his forehead and the sunken torso as the last breath had disappeared . </s>
<s> <s> Then a group would come and push us out of the way and reality kicked back . </s>
<s> <s> There is another amazing statue Disillusion by Francesco Queirolo which shows a man breaking free from a net . </s>
<s> <s> Downstairs is the Maccine anatomiche by Giuseppe Salerno done between 1763-64 which are two skeletons with all the blood vessels showing , one is an adult male and the other a pregnant woman . </s>
<s> <s> Initially it was believed to be a form of plastination by injecting the hardening substance into them while still alive but recent tests indicate the veins are made of beeswax , iron wire and silk - somewhat less gory . </s>
<s> <s> Back on the road to the Museo archeologico nazionale di Napoli which contains much of the mosaics and frescoes from Pompeii and other sights that disappeared under Mt. Vesuvius ’ fury . </s>
<s> <s> There are so many pieces to see , some almost childish as if you let your 6 year old draw on the walls while others are delicate and beautiful but all tell a story of life in Pompeii . </s>
<s> <s> There are many other interesting items from different areas such as the Farnese Bull found at the Roman Baths of Caracalla and of course what museum would be complete without an Egyptian collection . </s>
<s> <s> Scott was in rapture over a mosaic that depicts Alexander the Great , which he knew of but didn’t realise was here , and stood in front of it for what seemed like hours , gushing about it . </s>
<s> <s> We stopped for a late lunch on the way back to discuss all we had seen and do the usual people watching . </s>
<s> <s> Afterwards we dropped into the Cathedral behind our room , this is an enormous place with the side chapels as big as most churches and it is free to enter which is a nice change . </s>
<s> <s> Later we walked to the bus terminal to buy tickets to our next destination and the weather started to change . </s>
<s> <s> Dinner at the same restaurant in the piazza while some of the staff played music and started to dance while our waiter shook his head and laughed . </s>
<s> <s> There is such a rustic charm and unpretentious to this city . </s>
