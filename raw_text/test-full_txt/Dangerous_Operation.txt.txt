<s> <s> ORANGE , Tuesday , Jan. 24 . </s>
<s> <s> - A serious operation was performed on Thomas A. Edison , the investor , at his home , Glenmont , in Llewellyn Park , a suburb of West Orange , last last night , and at 1:30 o'clock this morning he had not recovered from the effects of the anaesthetic . </s>
<s> <s> The operation was for a mastoid abscess behind the left ear and very close to the brain . </s>
<s> <s> The doctors began work shortly before 11 o'clock and finished at midnight . </s>
<s> <s> The operating surgeon was Dr. Arthur B. Duel of 254 Madison Avenue , Manhattan , assisted by Dr. Edward B. Bench of 17 West Forty-fifth Street , an assistant , who administered the anaesthetic . </s>
<s> <s> Dr. John Hammond Bradshaw of Orange , the Edison family physician , was also present . </s>
<s> <s> Mr. Edison , as has been generally known , has been deaf for many years . </s>
<s> <s> He was taken ill about a year ago , suffering great pain , but was still able to be about . </s>
<s> <s> An operation was broached several days ago , but there was strong hope until yesterday that it might be avoided . </s>
<s> <s> It developed yesterday , however , that , while Mr. Edison was better in many particulars , the growth was not yielding to treatment , and the conclusion was reached that the operation would have to be performed at once . </s>
<s> <s> Mr. Edison was told , and immediately preparations were made . </s>
<s> <s> Dr. Duel arrived in Orange after dinner with his assistant . </s>
<s> <s> Mr. Edison seemed perfectly composed though fully realizing the seriousness of the matter . </s>
<s> <s> At 1:40 o'clock this morning it was said that Mr. Edison 's general condition was good and that there was no immediate danger . </s>
<s> <s> The operation was pronounced a success , and it was said that it had been performed just in time to save much more serious trouble . </s>
<s> <s> Dr. Bradshaw made the following statement : </s>
<s> <s> " It was decided this afternoon that it was best to operate before Mr. Edison 's life was placed in jeopardy and to prevent blood poisoning . </s>
<s> <s> The indications thus far are favorable . </s>
<s> <s> Mr. Edison has rallied well and there are no untoward symptoms at the present time . </s>
<s> <s> His life is not now considered in danger . " </s>
<s> <s> Dr. Duel , it was said , would remain at the patient 's bedside all night . </s>
<s> <s> The annual ball of the employes of the Edison works at West Orange , numbering about 2,000 , was held here to-night , under the auspices of the factory fire department . </s>
<s> <s> Many of the higher officials of the company attended , all being ignorant of the fact that their chief was under the surgeon 's knife . </s>
<s> <s> Mr. Edison is fifty-seven years old . </s>
