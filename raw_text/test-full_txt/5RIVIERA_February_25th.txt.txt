<s> <s> RIVIERA, February 25th. </s>
<s> <s> Everything is delightfully foreign in this ménage; Genevra lives in an apartment, as most people do here; hers is on the second floor, with a huge salon on one side of the hall, a salle à manger on the other, and the usual complement of bedrooms, kitchens, and the like. </s>
<s> <s> This is quite different from anything we have in America, where the apartments are on a scale of princely magnificence, with prices to match, or of a simplicity so extreme that " flat " seems to designate appropriately both them and the condition of those who inhabit them. </s>
<s> <s> This apartment is really a house on one floor; the entrance and stone stairway are quite palatial, and yet it is à bon marché. </s>
<s> <s> The drawing-room is spacious, with windows to the floor, opening out on balconies on which we step out to see the bersaglieri drill in the evenings, as the children are on the qui vive from the moment the spirited music reaches their ears. </s>
<s> <s> Genevra's large salon is heated by an open fire of olive-wood, which she says makes it warm enough except when the winters are unusually cold. </s>
<s> <s> The English ladies who come to tea in the afternoon throw aside their wraps, exclaiming, " Ah, Mrs. Fuller's drawing-room is always so very hot! "  </s>
<s> <s> Hot is not exactly the word that I should apply to dear Genevra's pretty drawing-room, although I know that Lucie and Marthe are piling on extra wood all the time in compliment to Mademoiselle, the shivering American. </s>
<s> <s> Everything in this house moves with a delightful smoothness and ease, and the whole atmosphere of the place is indescribably restful. </s>
<s> <s> When I awake in the morning I touch a bell, which soon brings to my bedside the trim, neat-handed Lucie with rolls and coffee. </s>
<s> <s> This morning my breakfast-tray was glorified with great bunches of dark purple and light Neapolitan violets. </s>
<s> <s> " What is the meaning of this reckless extravagance? " I call out to Genevra, whose room is next to mine. </s>
<s> <s> " Extravagance, ma belle! " replies Genevra. </s>
<s> <s> " Flowers are one of the economies of San Remo. </s>
<s> <s> If I were to carpet your path with violets it would be a cheap pleasure for me at the rate of two soldi a bunch!  </s>
<s> <s> " Was n't that like Genevra? - like the old Genevra, yet with a certain grace learned from these charming Italians!  </s>
<s> <s> Only half believing her, and yet comforted by her assurances, I enjoy the delicious fragrance of the violets while I luxuriously sip my coffee and read the opening pages of Ruffini's " Doctor Antonio. </s>
<s> <s> " Yesterday we drove to Bordighera, and Genevra and I tried to find the place near Ospedaletti where Sir John Davenne's coach came to grief by the roadside. </s>
<s> <s> It was disappointing to find no trace of Rosa's little inn, only great hotels, a casino, and all manner of extravagant and unromantic modern innovations. </s>
<s> <s> The sea and the picturesque coast are fortunately the same, and Genevra pointed out to me the great rock near which Battista rowed Lucy's boat while Antonio told Sir John how cleverly the valiant citizens of Bordighera had here outwitted the British in their brig-of-war. </s>
<s> <s> And on this road the Doctor walked home by moonlight, after an evening with Sir John and Lucy, singing " O bell ' alma innamorata! "  </s>
<s> <s> Poor, dear, brave Antonio - love, dear love, treated him shabbily enough!  </s>
<s> <s> Your mother will remember reading this story to me on one of my early visits to Woodford. </s>
<s> <s> Although I was but a child then, my wrath rose hot against Lucy's treatment of Antonio. </s>
<s> <s> After her marriage with Lord Cleverton I refused to listen to another word about the faithless Lucy, until curiosity and a real fondness for the pretty blonde heroine sent me back to this saddest of stories, over which I wept as girls of an earlier time wept over " The Sorrows of Werther. </s>
<s> <s> " This digression is all apropos of Bordighera, which is most interesting aside from its associations with Lucy and her lover, with its enchanting Coast Promenade ending at the Spianata del Capo. </s>
<s> <s> From this promontory there is a noble view of Ventimiglia, Mentone, Monaco, Villafranca and its light-house; beyond is the long, low line of the French shore, and still beyond, the Maritime Alps, with flecks of snow upon their sides, while near us, at our feet, lies the bay of Ospedaletti, sparkling in the sun. </s>
<s> <s> Bordighera is literally framed in by palm-trees - palms to right, to left, everywhere. </s>
<s> <s> No wonder that this little town long had the exclusive honor of supplying the palms to St. Peter's in Rome for Palm Sunday; but thereby hangs a tale which I may not relate to-day, as Genevra bids me drop my pen and join her and her friends over a cup of tea. </s>
