<s> <s> RIVIERA , February 22d . </s>
<s> <s> Of course the sun was shining when we left Genoa . </s>
<s> <s> We were glad to see how fair La Superba could be , with her terraced gardens , many villas , and noble background of blue mountains . </s>
<s> <s> Indeed , I confess to some qualms of conscience , feeling that I may have given you a too gloomy picture of the fine old city ; but how can one give a cheerful view of the attractions of a place where one 's gayest hours were spent in a cemetery ? </s>
<s> <s> Our way lay along the sea by the Western Riviera , one of the garden spots of the world . </s>
<s> <s> The railroad winds in and out among the rocks , or into tunnels pierced through them , often running parallel with the famous Cornice Drive , which was for many years the only road from Genoa to Nice . </s>
<s> <s> The beauty of this drive , which lies sometimes between the railroad and the sea and again ascends the rocky heights beyond , made us wish that railroads had never been invented . </s>
<s> <s> A coach and four , a Cinderella coach , would be the only suitable equipage in which to make this journey into fairyland . </s>
<s> <s> " Why did we not drive ? " </s>
<s> <s> I hear you ask , and you may well ask . </s>
<s> <s> Because the railroad , dashing in and out of tunnels , often crosses the drive most unexpectedly and on the grade . </s>
<s> <s> Even Zelphine , much as she wished to drive over the self-same road taken by her dear Lucy in " Doctor Antonio , " hesitated about imperilling her neck , and I was quite resolute upon this point . </s>
<s> <s> And if Zelphine and I were so reckless as to be willing to risk our own lives , have we not under our care the only and well-beloved daughter of the ancient and honorable house of Haldane ? </s>
<s> <s> Did I say that the train dashed ? </s>
<s> <s> Really , that was a slip of the pen - nothing dashes in Italy except a mountain torrent ; but where there are so many grade crossings , even a slow train may be dangerous . </s>
<s> <s> We proceeded moderately and sedately upon our shining way , skirting the sapphire sea , dotted here and there with green islands . </s>
<s> <s> Reaching far out into the blue , one may see small towns which seem bent upon washing their white houses to a more dazzling whiteness in the clear water , painted towns against a painted sea and sky . </s>
<s> <s> Other hamlets and villas , with their green jalousies and their luxuriant gardens full of flowers and orange-trees , are on the heights above , and not seldom a solitary sanctuary is seen , perched upon some sea-washed cliff , the cherished guardian of the shore . </s>
<s> <s> Now indeed , looking up at the terraced olive-groves , we feel that we are in Italy . </s>
<s> <s> For many miles the road lies beside these gardens , which are monuments to Italian thrift and industry , as every square inch of the scanty earth on the hillsides is held in place by stone walls , one above another , until some are almost mountain high , olive-trees growing to the very top . </s>
<s> <s> On the sunny plains between the hills are acres of carnations , violets , stock-gillies , and mignonette , which fill the air with their delicious fragrance . </s>
<s> <s> From these immense gardens the large cities are supplied with flowers , and also the manufactories of perfumes . </s>
<s> <s> Hundreds of the beautiful blossoms , they tell us , are sacrificed to make a single drop of essence . </s>
<s> <s> We passed by Albenga and Alassio , over the suspension bridge at Porto Maurizio , and so on to Taggia , which is near San Remo , where we three were to part company for a few days . </s>
<s> <s> Off to the right we could see the picturesque ruins of Bussana Vecchia , destroyed by an earthquake as late as 1887 , never rebuilt , and now standing silent and desolate on the hill-top above its namesake , the little modern town of Bussana Nuova . </s>
<s> <s> Our view of Poggio and Bussana Vecchia was suddenly cut off by an inopportune tunnel , from which we emerged into the brilliant sunshine , to see before us the pretty villas , the waving palms , and the general air of cultivation and bien-être that belong to this favorite and highly favored town . </s>
<s> <s> When Zelphine and Angela caught this glimpse of San Remo from the train , and saw Genevra 's children waiting for me at the station , I am quite sure they repented them of their decision . </s>
<s> <s> I had not seen Roger and Phœbe since they were babies , but I knew them at once , and we are already fast friends . </s>
<s> <s> Genevra 's welcome , as you may believe , was of the warmest . </s>
<s> <s> It is delightful to be in a home again , after tossing about in a state-room and knocking around in strange hotels , and in a home as charming as this ! </s>
