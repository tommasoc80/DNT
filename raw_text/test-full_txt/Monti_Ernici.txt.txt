<s> <s> Monti Ernici : a taste of the Scottish Highlands a short drive from Rome </s>
<s> <s> July 6 , 2016 </s>
<s> <s> I’ve mentioned before that one of my favourite things about living in Rome is its proximity to the Apennines . </s>
<s> <s> When I lived in London it was a five or six hour drive to the best hill walking areas of Snowdonia or the Lake District , and a day or more to some of the less accessible peaks in Scotland . </s>
<s> <s> Here in Rome the highest peaks in the the Apennines – in Gran Sasso and Maiella national parks – are only a couple of hours away . </s>
<s> <s> These mountains are twice as high as anything in the UK . </s>
<s> <s> Corno Grande , the highest , is 2912m , while Britain’s highest peak , Ben Nevis , reaches only 1344m . </s>
<s> <s> You might expect these mountains to be very different , but because of the warmer climate here in Italy , they have much in common , and UK hill walkers would feel very much at home here ( as I talked about in a previous post ) . </s>
<s> <s> A couple of weekends ago Edita and I visited Monti Ernici , a group of hills little more than an hour’s drive from Rome , that reminded me so much of the Scottish Highlands that I just had to write a blog post about them . </s>
<s> <s> They weren’t the Scottish Highlands of course , which meant the contrasts were just as noticeable as the similarities . </s>
<s> <s> So here are 4 ways they resemble the Scottish hills and 4 ways they don’t , and a fair sprinkling of photos , so that if you know Scotland well you can judge for yourself . </s>
<s> <s> Four ways Monti Ernici resemble the Scottish Highlands </s>
<s> <s> 1 . They are a peak bagger’s paradise </s>
<s> <s> In the same way British hill walkers have the Munros ( 283 peaks in Scotland over 3000 feet in height ) , Italian hill walkers have the Apennine 2000ers ( 249 peaks over 2000 metres in height ) . </s>
<s> <s> While some people dismiss peak bagging as ticking over experiencing I prefer to look at it another way . </s>
<s> <s> The existence of such a list takes you to areas you wouldn’t otherwise visit , and while a desire to tick a few peaks off a list may have drawn you there in the first place , the beauty of the mountains means that the experience of a good day out far outweighs anything else you might take home with you . </s>
<s> <s> Monti Ernici is a lesser known group of mountains , far less popular than the peaks of Gran Sasso , Maiella or Abruzzo National Park , to name but three . </s>
<s> <s> We may never had heard about them , but for the fact that five peaks over 2000m ( 2041m Pizzo Deta , 2007m Monte Pratillo , 2064m Monte del Passeggio , 2004m Monte Ginepro , and 2005m Monte Fragara ) could be climbed in a single day . </s>
<s> <s> And what a day out it proved to be . </s>
<s> <s> 2 . They are about the same size </s>
<s> <s> Without wishing to teach your grandmother how to suck eggs , 2000 metres is a lot higher than 3000 feet . </s>
<s> <s> In fact , it’s more than twice as high . </s>
<s> <s> 3000 feet isn’t even 1000 metres ( it’s only 914 ) . </s>
<s> <s> This suggests the Apennine 2000ers must be on a different scale to Scottish Munros , and climbing them must be a much more challenging proposition . </s>
<s> <s> Not so . </s>
<s> <s> Many Apennine peaks rise above high-altitude plateaus ( or altipiano ) 1000m or more above sea level , which means in terms of scale they are about the same size as many mountains in Scotland . </s>
<s> <s> We started our climb of Monti Ernici from a place called Prato di Campoli , an area of pasture land at 1143m , which puts it above the summits of all but 25 of Scotland’s 283 Munros . </s>
<s> <s> All of the five summits we climbed were less than 1000m above us . </s>
<s> <s> Our circular walk took 7 ½ hours , with a total ascent ( up and down a few times ) of around 1400m – a good day out , but not a massive one . </s>
<s> <s> 3 . There is some great ridge walking </s>
<s> <s> My favourite hill walks are definitely ridge walks . </s>
<s> <s> While it’s good exercise striding up a hill , and it can often be fun running back down again , I do it for the views , the sense of space , and the opportunity to marvel in the colour and diversity of the natural world around us . </s>
<s> <s> Ridge walks have a roof of the world feel to them . </s>
<s> <s> You can walk for miles with views for vast distances on both sides . </s>
<s> <s> You can wander along , soaking it all up , knowing that most of the strenuous ascent is behind you . </s>
<s> <s> Some ridges in the Scottish Highlands contain multiple summits , with a certain amount of ascent and descent in between . </s>
<s> <s> Many Munros are joined by long ridges . </s>
<s> <s> Once you’ve climbed the first one , a few more can be polished off without needing to go back down again . </s>
<s> <s> The Monti Ernici quintet was very much in this mould . </s>
<s> <s> Once we reached the first summit , Pizzo Deta , the bulk of the climbing was behind us , and we remained above 1700m for the rest of the day , until it was time to go back down again . </s>
<s> <s> There was a drop of about 200m to Monte Ginepro , the most outlying of the group , but the other four all lay on the same broad ridge , falling away in cliffs to the north and more gentle grassland to the south . </s>
<s> <s> From that ridge we could see mountain ranges all around , the Simbruini peaks close at hand to the west , Sirente-Velino close by to the north , and Gran Sasso behind that . </s>
<s> <s> To the east were the peaks of Abruzzo , and Maiella beyond . </s>
<s> <s> We enjoyed the view all the more , knowing that we have climbed peaks in all of these ranges . </s>
<s> <s> Being atop a ridge like that , and identifying the mountains around you , is like putting together the pieces in a jigsaw puzzle . </s>
<s> <s> 4 . Grassy tops and rocky outcrops </s>
<s> <s> The top of the Monti Ernici ridge is very familiar to any Scottish hill walker : a broad grassy ridge with rocky outcrops . </s>
<s> <s> There are even carpets of a heather-like plant . </s>
<s> <s> The ridge falls away abruptly into cliffs on its northern side , but falls more gently to the south in swathes of lush green grass . </s>
<s> <s> We are 2000 kilometres further south and 1000 metres higher , and the climate must be remarkably similar . </s>
<s> <s> Four ways Monti Ernici are different from the Scottish Highlands </s>
<s> <s> 1 . Accessibility </s>
<s> <s> I’ve already touched on this one , but according to Google Maps , the Monti Ernici are just 1 hour 23 minutes by car from our house near the Appia Antica in Rome . </s>
<s> <s> Residents of Naples have only a little further to go : 1 hour 59 minutes . </s>
<s> <s> The population of Rome is around 3 million while the metropolitan area of Naples is closer to 4 million . </s>
<s> <s> If you take these two cities alone then 7 million people have Monti Ernici on their doorstep . </s>
<s> <s> Scotland’s most accessible Munros are Ben Lomond and the Arrochar Alps on the western side of Loch Lomond , 1 hour 6 minutes from Glasgow , an urban conurbation of some 2.3 million people . </s>
<s> <s> The entire population of Scotland is just 5.3 million . </s>
<s> <s> Not all of them have Munros so close . </s>
<s> <s> You would think Monti Ernici must therefore be crawling with hikers , but during the whole of our walk on a sunny Saturday in June we saw just 3 people . </s>
<s> <s> Two of them were setting flags for a fell race the following day , while the other was waiting for them on a nearby summit . </s>
<s> <s> Otherwise we had the entire range to ourselves . </s>
<s> <s> 2 . Forests </s>
<s> <s> One thing you won’t see in Scotland is lush forest reaching up the side of a mountain almost to the summits . </s>
<s> <s> There used to be much more forest in Scotland , but since the wolves and bears were eradicated and the deer , who nibble at the shoots of saplings , lost their last natural predators , the forests have shrunk . </s>
<s> <s> This hasn’t happened in Italy . </s>
<s> <s> There are cervi ( red deer ) and caprioli ( roe deer ) just like there are in the UK , but there are also bears and wolves . </s>
<s> <s> Many peaks in the Apennines are carpeted in forest from around 500m all the way up to the treeline at 1600m to 1700m . </s>
<s> <s> The same is true on Monti Ernici , giving the lower flanks of the mountain a very different look to the barren , windswept tops of most of Scotland’s peaks . </s>
<s> <s> It adds another dimension to navigation . </s>
<s> <s> In Scotland you’re much more likely to become lost in mist , but as long as it’s clear you can always find your way down from a trackless hillside . </s>
<s> <s> Here in Italy the weather is usually clearer , but if you don’t stay on the path you’re much more likely to become lost in deep forest . </s>
<s> <s> 3 . Weather </s>
<s> <s> Scotland gets some bad rap about its weather . </s>
<s> <s> Many’s the time I’ve experienced a bleak day of trekking in the Himalayas , Andes or just about anywhere in the world really , walking through damp mist on a rocky trail . </s>
<s> <s> Before long you can can guarantee someone will come out with the line : </s>
<s> <s> “ I could be in Scotland . ” </s>
<s> <s> ( There’s usually a profanity at the start of the sentence too , but I will let you imagine that part . ) </s>
<s> <s> This reputation for horrible damp misty weather where you can’t see beyond the end of your trekking pole is completely justified . </s>
<s> <s> We’ve all had days like that in the Scottish hills if we’ve been there more than once . </s>
<s> <s> It certainly improves your navigation . </s>
<s> <s> I once had a sales assistant in Aviemore in the Cairngorms argue with me that my Garmin GPS was completely waterproof . </s>
<s> <s> When I told him it didn’t work for a week after using it during a rainstorm in the Cuillin Hills on the Isle of Skye , he looked at me and laughed . </s>
<s> <s> “ Ach , well , if you’d told me you were using it on Skye ! ” </s>
<s> <s> In fairness I’ve experienced some lovely sunny days walking in Scotland when the weather was as perfect as can be . </s>
<s> <s> But all of these days have to be balanced against the days of damp wet mist and sheeting rain that you have to expect in Scotland . </s>
<s> <s> It’s not like that here in the Apennines . </s>
<s> <s> Sure , there are crap days here too , but those days are few and far between . </s>
<s> <s> Now that it’s the summer we can expect beautiful sunny skies for most of the day , and if we get some cloud then we’re unlucky . </s>
<s> <s> Sorry Scotland ! </s>
<s> <s> 4 . Crosses and virgins on the summit </s>
<s> <s> I’ll finish with a more frivolous one . </s>
<s> <s> When the Rev. A.E Robertson climbed his last Munro in 1901 , thus becoming the first person to complete them all , he is said to have kissed the cairn and then his wife , in that order . </s>
<s> <s> Some people might think that kissing a cairn is a bit weird , but not half as weird as kissing the summit monument at the top of an Apennine peak . </s>
<s> <s> Being 1 hour and 23 minutes from Rome means we’re also 1 hour and 23 minutes from the Pope’s residence . </s>
<s> <s> Italy is a much more Catholic country than the UK . </s>
<s> <s> While we have cairns and trig points on our summits , here in Italy it’s more usually crosses and statues of the Madonna . </s>
<s> <s> Here’s who greeted me on the summit of Pizzo Deta . </s>
<s> <s> I didn’t kiss her . </s>
