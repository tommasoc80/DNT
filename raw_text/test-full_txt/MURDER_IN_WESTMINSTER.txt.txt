<s> <s> MONDAY , OCTOBER 1 , 1888 </s>
<s> <s> MURDER IN WESTMINSTER </s>
<s> <s> Shortly before eleven o'clock , on Saturday night , a man named John Brown murdered his wife Sarah by cutting her head nearly off , at the house at which they lived , No. 11 , Regent-gardens , Regency-street , Westminster . </s>
<s> <s> The deceased was a laundress , and her husband is employed as a roadman in St. James 's Park . </s>
<s> <s> On the 17th ult . she summoned him to the Westminster Police-court , before Mr. D'Eyncourt , for maintenance , on the ground of having been deserted for a period of six weeks . </s>
<s> <s> The deceased then produced a medical certificate to the effect that her husband 's violent conduct and excitable temperament justified her in refusing to cohabit with him . </s>
<s> <s> The magistrate made no order for support , and the woman seems shortly afterwards to have very reluctantly resumed cohabitation with her husband , who was very jealous of her , and has frequently been heard to threaten her , asserting that she had been unfaithful - a statement for which there did not appear to be the slightest foundation . </s>
<s> <s> On Saturday night , at ten minutes to eleven , a next-door neighbour heard the pair quarrelling in their room , which was a front apartment on the ground floor . </s>
<s> <s> The noise suddenly ceased , and a minute or two afterwards the man left the house hurriedly , loudly slamming the front door , and walked at once to the Rochester-row Police-station , where he told Inspector Fairey , A Division , who was on duty , that he had murdered his wife by cutting her throat . </s>
<s> <s> He handed the inspector a large spring-backed clasp-knife , which had marks of blood on it , as also had his clothes , and described how he had twice stabbed the woman in the neck . </s>
<s> <s> Detective-sergeant Waldock , of the Criminal Investigation Department , was at once despatched to investigate the matter , and found the deceased with her head nearly cut from her body in a pool of blood near the fireplace in the room . </s>
<s> <s> Dr. Archer , of Vincent-square , Westminster , was sent for , and he found the body still warm , but life was extinct . </s>
<s> <s> The doctor expressed the opinion that great force must have been employed to have cut the woman 's throat in such a shocking way , for there were two distinct gashes , and the wind-pipe was severed . </s>
<s> <s> The two little children belonging to the deceased were crying in the passage , and were taken away by neighbours . </s>
<s> <s> The man Brown , who is forty-five years of age , a little older than the deceased , was subsequently formally charged with wilful murder , and he will be brought before the magistrate at the Westminster Police-court this morning . </s>
