<s> <s> NAPLES , March 4th . </s>
<s> <s> We have spent the morning at the National Museum , where are so many of the world-famous sculptures , the Hercules , a magnificent , strong figure in perfect repose , a giant taking his ease , and the Farnese Bull , both of them from the Baths of Caracalla in Rome , and a huge bronze horse from Herculaneum . </s>
<s> <s> Most impressive and interesting to us is the statue of Diana of the Ephesians , against whose worship Paul preached at Ephesus . </s>
<s> <s> A curious statue is this , odd enough to have fallen down from Jupiter , according to the tradition , or from any other heathen god ! </s>
<s> <s> The torso is of fine , variegated marble , and the head , hands , and feet , the latter slender and delicate , are of bronze . </s>
<s> <s> This Diana is not a huntress , like the Greek Artemis with the crescent above her brow , but bears about her the symbols of abundance . </s>
<s> <s> We lingered long near this statue of the great goddess of the Ephesians , marvelling wherein lay the secret of her power . </s>
<s> <s> To Demetrius and the other silversmiths who made her shrines she was valuable , as she brought them great gain ; but for beauty or grace there was no reason why this Diana should have been worshipped by " Asia and all the world . " </s>
<s> <s> Among the bronzes from Pompeii and Herculaneum we found the originals of many of the exquisitely graceful figures with which we are all familiar . </s>
<s> <s> We greeted as old friends the Dancing Faun , the Mercury , the Flying Victory , the Wrestlers , Silenus , the Boy with the Dolphin , and , above all , the lovely Narcissus , which they now call by another name . </s>
<s> <s> Zelphine and I have decided that we will never acknowledge this to be a Dionysus or anything less poetic than the Narcissus . </s>
<s> <s> This charming , youthful figure with the bent head and listening ear is quite small , not nearly life-size , and for that reason , perhaps , its beauty is more delicate and spiritual . </s>
<s> <s> If that little figure could speak , what could it not tell of pomp , luxury , love , and delight , all overtaken and overwhelmed by sudden destruction in the buried city where it was found ! </s>
<s> <s> Now , indeed , if it were in my power to rhyme four lines and make sense at the same time , which was my school-girl idea of poetry-making , I should certainly be sending you a poem about the Narcissus ; but why cudgel my brains when Keats has , with his own sympathetic charm , told the pathetic story of the beautiful youth ? </s>
<s> <s> - " Who gazed into the stream 's deep recess And died of his own dear loveliness . " </s>
<s> <s> On our way home from the museum our vetturino beat his horse so unmercifully , although the poor nag was going as fast as a horse could be expected to go up hill , that Zelphine remonstrated with him , very tactfully , as I thought , paying his sorry Rosinante compliments and calling the wretched beast il buono cavallo . </s>
<s> <s> The idea of any one feeling compassion for a horse evidently touched the driver 's sense of humor , and , regarding it as a huge joke , he laughed and whipped the poor animal still more unmercifully , making us understand , in the gibberish of French and Italian peculiar to the cabmen here , that there was no need to be merciful to a creature without a soul . </s>
<s> <s> We longed for greater facility in some language that he could understand , to inquire into his own spiritual condition . </s>
<s> <s> As , however , words were wanting , we fell to wondering wherein such a being as this differs from the beasts of the field . </s>
<s> <s> The cabmen of Naples would certainly afford our friend Dr. C. an additional argument in favor of his pet doctrine of conditional immortality . </s>
<s> <s> Our driver 's attitude toward the animal creation is , we are told , that of most Neapolitans . </s>
<s> <s> Even persons of more intelligence question the advisability of caring for the comfort of dumb creatures , yet these apparently cruel people have a most kindly custom . </s>
<s> <s> If parents lose a child , and children are generally so numerous that it seems as if one could scarcely be missed , they adopt an orphan , call it God 's child , and treat it as their own . </s>
