NAPLES Naples is situated at 40 ° -51 ' -47" north latitude and 11 ° -54 ' -40 " east of Paris. No town in Europe is better situated. It has the appearance of an Amphitheatre, above a Crater of about 73 miles in circumference from Cape Miseno, to the point of Posillipo, closed on one side by the Island of Capri, and Procida and Ischia on the other. On the north of Naples rises Vesuvius isolated, that fully compensate our little and momentary fears by the beautiful and sublime sight of its eruption. No place will be found more populate than at the foot of the Volcano. In sight of Naples and almost chained to each other lie the fine Villages of Portici, Resina, the two tower of Del Greco, and Annunziata with the remains of Erculanum and Pompei. Ou the other side the Posillipo hill with the tombs of Virgilio and Sannazzaro. The chain of the Appenine is alto seen at a distance, a spur of which surrounding Vesuvius it parts and joins a portion of the Naples Grater near Cape Misene. On this side and opposite Naples lies Castellamare, Vico, Sorrento where Tasso was born, and Massa. All this forms a most beautiful picturesque and theatrical appearance and reminds one to be worth visiting.
