Drink 
Naples is becoming increasingly popular with a younger generation of both Italians and foreigners. In spite of false and stereotypical reports of adverse conditions, they flood into the city and lend renewed vitality to its nightlife. The hippest scene is around the bars and cafes on Piazza Bellini, Piazza Santa Maria la Nova and Piazza San Domenico Maggiore, becoming busy after about 11PM. You should also try the area around Piazza dei Martiri, expecially Vico Belledonne a Chiaia, where you can find many crowded bars, a winebar and lots of young people, expecially at weekends. However, if you are looking for a American/English/Northern European drinking establishments you may be hard pressed to find what you are looking for as that culture is frowned upon in Naples. There are a variety of small drinking establishments but if you 're looking for a crowded beer hall, Irish pub, or an American college-style dive bar, you 'll have trouble finding one. If you 're in Naples and wondering what local beverages to try, the first answer is that Naples is as famous for its extra-strong, semi-sweet coffee as it is for its pizza, and you can try some at places like Gran Caffe Aragonese with a little ice cream floating on top or at Caffe Gambrinus, which also serves cake and cocktails. Amazingly, coffee is so thoroughly Neapolitan that it is commonly sold at local bars as well. For those who would like to try the local beer and wine, there are an abundance of options. Beer bars were once rare, beer being traditionally sold with and consumed in pizza parlors, but now they are more common. Wine bars are classic in Naples, which is not surprising since it is the capital of Campania, a major wine-producing region. There are many local varieties of wine you may wish to sample, but the Aglianico is peculiarly appropriate. Aglianico black grapes are grown throughout southern Italy, but Campania provides them with their ideal soil and growing climate.
