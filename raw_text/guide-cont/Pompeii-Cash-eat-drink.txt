Pompei
Cash Only 
An ATM is located in the ticket office area near the Pompei Scavi train station, there is no ATM inside the site and credit cards are not accepted, so make sure to bring enough cash for your needs.

Update: There is a modern air-conditioned food court building in the centre of the site. Soft drinks, cafe, pizza, main courses, sandwiches, crisps, and other items are available for purchase. Credit cards are accepted. This will generally be your only lunch option within the site, though food is allowed inside, as you will see many Asian tour groups stopping to consume bento box type meals. See bullet below in section "Eat".

Buy
Interesting plastic "past & present" books sold for €12 by vendors. Deal with them for an even better price
Buy a tour guide book for €5, so you can read more about the interesting city history, building and artifacts. There is so much to learn from the Romans and to see how they lived. On Amazon uk you can purchase 'Pompeii - a guide for the casual visitor'.
Cameos. These are a local speciality and tour buses frequently stop at a factory.

Eat
On the way from the station to the official entrance loads of shops try to sell stuff for very expensive prices but the food is not outstanding. Drinks, especially the freshly pressed orange and lemon juices, however, are fantastic especially in the heat, though slightly pricey (€ 3.00 for a glass)
You can get a very good panino (filled bread roll) from some of the stands. The one at the end near the Porta Marina has fantastic ones.
There is a café and restaurant in the excavation area, just north of the Forum. Not surprisingly, this is rather expensive and not particularly good. Nonetheless, it is an OK place to take a break and recuperate, particularly with its air conditioning. If you don't have time for a rest you can grab a €3.50 ice cream from a service window that faces the street. The restaurant has toilets, seemingly the only ones on the site.
