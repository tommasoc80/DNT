Sleep 
Accommodation in Naples is normally cheaper than in Rome or northern Italian cities, but quality may vary a lot. It's not uncommon to encounter hot water shortages, short power outages and less than luxurious bed and bath linens. Also do n't expect a full-sized bathtub in reasonably priced hotels. You may not even get a shower stall in the bathroom, but a drain hole that is in the center of the bathroom with a toilet, a sink and a shower head along the plain tiled walls. Breakfast may include weak orange juice (tasting more like powdered orange drink), hard rolls and an assortment of hard meats and cheeses. Nothing mentioned here is meant to discourage, but to help you view your experience as an adventure in Italian culture.
