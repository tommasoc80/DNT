History 
The city of Naples is thought to be one of the oldest continually inhabited cities on the planet, but its recorded history began when Greek settlers established colonies in the area during the second millennium B.C. Later, another colony, called Parthenope, was founded by more Greek colonists from the Aegean island of Rhodes during the ninth century B.C. Parthenope eventually declined, however, and the true beginning of Naples (as such) was found in the new Greek settlement called Neapolis during the sixth century B.C. Neapolis became of major importance within the Greek Mediterranean empire called Magna Graecia (Greater Greece) and an important center of trade. It allied itself with Rome against Carthage during the Punic Wars and again during the war with the Italian Samnite tribe. Ultimately, Naples (Neapolis) became a Roman colony and a key portal through which Greek culture entered Italy and merged with Roman culture. After the Western Roman Empire fell to the Germanic barbarians in the fifth century A.D., Naples fell first to the Ostrogoths, then to the Byzantines, and then became an independent duchy. By 763, it had fallen under Papal control but regained its independence around A.D. 800. Naples then engaged in numerous local feuds with adjacent kingdoms, until in the 11th Century, when it hired Norman mercenaries to gain the upper hand. By 1137, however, the Normans took control of Naples itself along with much of the Italian Peninsula. Around 1266, Naples became united with Sicily as part of the new Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, and soon, it was made the capital of the new kingdom. Sicily and Naples were then divided and reunited several times over the next few centuries and were, at points, under the Iberian Kingdom of Aragon. Around 1501, Naples came under Spanish control, but after passing again through numerous masters, it was finally again the independent Kingdom of Naples. Naples later became a strong proponent of the Italian unification movement, and joined modern Italy in 1861. Much of the cityscape of modern Naples was built under Mussolini's fascist regime and also during the reconstruction era following World War II. Although Naples never revolted against Mussolini, it was the first city in Italy to rebel against the Nazi occupation and was also the most-bombed city in all of Italy. The city was liberated by American and British forces on October 1,1943. Between 1950 and 1984, Naples received financial assistance from the Italian government under The Fund of the South, to help it rebuild. Since then, Naples has continued to build: it constructed a massive business district, a highly advanced city transport system, and a high-speed rail link to both Rome and Salerno. It has also boomed economically and seen unemployment drop. Naples now has the fourth-largest economy of any urban zone in Italy, has one of the busiest sea ports in the Mediterranean, and with a GDP of about $ 84 billion, ranks as the 103rd most wealthy city on the planet.
