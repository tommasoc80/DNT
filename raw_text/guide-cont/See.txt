In Naples, some may find the actual conditions of many buildings and streets, and the rampant graffiti, off-putting. Others claim this is "the immense character and culture of Napoli... and even the dirt and grime has its own flavor... a Neapolitan recipe for reality, and great fun". Naples' peculiarity is that the city centre is not the elegant part of the city. Just do not expect in the city centre the pristine conditions of many other major European cities, since the historical centre, unlike most European cities, is not the "downtown". If you want to visit the elegant part of the city, you can walk around the wonderful lungomare (the Riviera di Chiaia or Via Francesco Caracciolo), and visit Via dei Mille and Vomero hill (main shopping areas). Most sites in Campania (including Pompeii) accept the Campania Card for tourists (free entry). Some cards also include a pass for the local public transportation.
