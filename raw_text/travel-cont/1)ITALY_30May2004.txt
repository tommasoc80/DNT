ITALY

Sun 30 May 2004

Today we went for an early morning drive to look at the beautiful Amalfi coast "before everyone gets up" Denise said. Ha ha! We left at 7.30am and when we got to Sorrento on the coast the traffic was terrible. We were in a 'convoy' along with 17 tour buses and that is where we stayed driving the Amalfi Way for about 3 hours. We could only drive along the coast at about 10k per hour with hundreds of cars driving in both directions and looking for parks and hundreds already parked to see the view. The road is so narrow that cars had to back up to let buses through. Numerous S bends and switchback made it a nightmare. Wonderful views however and perfect weather and we could take lots of photos at that speed.

When we got to the village of Maiori we gave up and turned left for a road to the Autostrada back to Pompeii. Bad mistake. Although the sign said 'To the A3' it didn't say how far away it was. So over the mountains we went again on tiny roads with switchbacks and small villages for about 60 minutes. We got to Corbara, then to Angri but somewhere we took a wrong turn (again) and ended back at Angri - yes angry for us. Studying the map we finally ended back on the A3 Autostrada. I also ran a redlight on the road which turned out to be a one lane tunnel but we managed to scrape through without hitting an oncoming car! Back to the hotel and pizza lunch.

We caught the train from Pompeii to Herculaneum in the afternoon. Herculaneum is ruins similar to Pompeii but closer to the coast and have been nicely excavated. Quite impressive to walk through it. Then took the train back to Pompeii (80 Km).
