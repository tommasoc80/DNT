Laborers Strike in Rotterdam
Military Ordered Out to Preserve the Peace

Rotterdam, May 16
Six thousand dock laborers in this city have gone on strike because of a reduction in their wages, and four battalions of the National Guard have been called out as a precaution against any riotous demonstrations on the part of the strikers. Three gunboats are also lying opposite the city in readiness for action should their services be required to protect the shipping.

Mr. Joseph Havelock Wilson, member of the British House of Commons for Middleborough, who is now in Rotterdam, escorted by a detachment of soldiers, had an interview with the Mayor and Chief of Police this morning.

The seamen on board the British vessels lying at this port last evening resolved that they would refuse to comply with the demand they perform the work of the strikers in loading and discharging cargo, and the consequence is that fifty steamers are detained here.
