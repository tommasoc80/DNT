Englishman's Motor Race

PARIS. June 28.—S. F. Edge, an Englishman, won the James Gordon Bennett Cup in the automobile contest, reaching Innspruck (Austria) ahead of his French competitors, including Knyff, who, after leading every one until he was twenty-five miles from Innspruck, broke down. This is the first time the cup will leave France.

Mr. Edge's time from Paris to Belfort and from Bregenz to Innspruck was 10 hours, 41 minutes, and 58 seconds.

Baron de Forest arrived at Salzburg (the third stage of the international race from Paris to Vienna) first, at 1:34:20 P. M. His average speed from Bregenz to Salzburg was 44½ miles per hour.

Many of the competitors met with slight accidents, owing to the rough condition of the roads.

The Austrian Emperor’s brother, Archduke Ludwig, and Archdukes Leopold and Joseph Ferdinand and the local functionaries witnessed the arrival of the racers at Salzburg from the grand stand. The very large crowds of spectators gave Baron de Forest an ovation.
