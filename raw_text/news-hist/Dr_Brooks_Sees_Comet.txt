Dr. Brooks Sees Comet

GENEVA, N. Y., July 19.â€”Finley's periodic comet, which was recently seen at Heidelberg, was observed by Dr. William R. Brooks, at Smith Observatory last night. Its position was 23 hours, 53 minutes, 30 seconds right ascension; 13 degrees, 3 seconds declination south. It is on the tail of the constellation Cetus, and moving slowly northeast. The light of the comet is rather faint, but will increase in brightness until September, when the comet is nearest the sun.
