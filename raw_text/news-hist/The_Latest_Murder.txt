The Latest Murder

It was probably not committed by "Jack the Ripper."

The doctors convinced that there are two series of crimes and two men who commit them - One a more skilful dissector than the other - another compromise rejected.

London, Sept 11 - Although the murder discovered early yesterday morning in the Whitechapel street is generally spoken of as the mysterious "Jack the Ripper", a close examination of all the facts leads that this murder is not of the ripper series. The police and the medical men familiar with the details of the recent London horrors of this class say that this murder must be classified with those known as the embankment murders, of which there have now been four in all, including the one in which the headless body of the victim was recently discovered in Chelsea, and of which the head has never been found. Although there is a general resemblance between the horrible work of the two murderers, both taking special pains to mutilate their victims and to carry off portions of the bodies, each carries off a different portion. Besides this there are other evidences of difference in expertness in the surgical work involved in all the mutilations, the embankment murderer being by far the more scientific of the two.

For some time it was doubtful whether all these horrors were the work of one or two persons, but this last murder convinces the medical men that there are two entirely distinct sets of murders and two different men responsible for them. It is believed that in the present instance the body was purposely brought to the Whitechapel district to throw the police off the scent by inducing the belief that the body was that of another victim of Jack the Ripper. In this the peretrator, however, went to trouble that is entirely superfluous for the police are as much in the fog about the one class of murders as the other.
