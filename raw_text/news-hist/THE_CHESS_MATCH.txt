THE CHESS MATCH

Everything is now ready for the second section of the match between J. H. Zukertort and Wilhelm Steinitz, the greatest chess players of the day. The number of games to be played here will be at least three, and probably more. The stakes are $2,000 a side, and the time limit is fifteen moves per hour. The umpires will be Ben R. Foster for Steinitz and William Duncan for Zukertort. The contest will open at Harmonie Club, Olive and Eighteenth Streets, at 2'oclock this afternoon. No tickets will be disposed of at the door, and they can be secured only from the members of the Committee on Arrangements. The New York Chess Club has made preparations for exhibiting each move as it is telegraphed on, as well as any interesting events of the match. The New York Evening Telegram will have a reporter for its paper. Henry Turner, President of the Brooklyn chess club, is in the city, and will witness the contest.

"The first five games", says a gentleman writing from the East, "were very unsatisfactory. Both players played badly and did themselves no credit. The games will not bear analysis, and only prove that earlier the players are entirely out of practice or are not possessed of sufficient nerve to play for such high stakes, or that they have deteriorated in their play."

Spectators will be permitted to use pocket chess boards only for following the games, but no analysis of them is allowed and loud conversation can not be indulged in. The Secretary of the Chess, Checker, and Whist Club, S. M. Joseph, 103 North Broadway, will furnish tickets on application to him. A large attendance at the match is expected.
