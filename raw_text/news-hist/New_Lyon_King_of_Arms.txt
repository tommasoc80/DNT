NEW LYON KING OF ARMS
The King has been pleased, on the recommendation of the Secretary of State for Scotland, to approve of the appointment of Captain George Sitwell Campbell Swinton, at present Albany Herald to be Lyon King of Arms in Scotland and Secretary to the Order of the Thistle in succession to Sir James Balfour Paul, K.C.V.O., LL.D., whose resignation takes effect as from December 31,1926.

Sir James Balfour Paul, who will be 80 next November, has been Lyon King since 1890. The great improvement in Scottish heraldic art is due largely to his wise encouragement of Mr. Grahame Johnston, the Herald Painter to his Court, Mr. Law Samson., and other artists in according to the armorial designs issued by the Lyon Office a vigour of treatment reminiscent of the best period of heraldry. He is deeply learned and scholarly antiquary, as his published works prove.

Captain Swinton, formerly March Pursuivant of Arms, has been Albany Herald since 1923, and is well qualified for the difficult task of succeeding Sir James Balfour Paul. He has served a long time on the L.C.C., was chairman of the Town Planning Committee of the new Delhi, and was hon. secretary of the Scottish National War Memorial Committee in 1918.
