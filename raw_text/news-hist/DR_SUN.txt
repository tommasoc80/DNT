DR. SUN'S ELECTION IS NOT TAKEN SERIOUSLY

SHANGHAI, Dec.30.

Dr. Sun Yat-sen, interviewed here today by the correspondent of THE NEW YORK TIMES, said he accepts the Presidency. not doubting that the convention will adopt a republican form of government. and that conditions will quickly settle and trade revive.

He expained that the beginning of the revolution was premature, but it had been carefully planned. He also was unable, he said , to outline any policy until his cabinet is organized. He will proceed to NanKing soon.

Dr. Sun Yat-sen was elected by fifty delegates, who were not accredited except for letters from revolutionary provincial leaders. some of these already have been deposed, and one should not take too seriously the result. which was partly due to a foreign intrigue which provoked the revolution first.

Dr. Sun's election, occuring simultaneously with the peace delegates agreeing to refer the form of government to the convention. indicates a lack of harmony among the republicans, which partly stultifies the work of Dr. Wu Ting-Fang and apparently violates the understanding with Yuan Shi-Kai.

The leaders will not admit that there are differences. All may be adjusted. but the situation indicates that there will be a republic eventually, with Yuan Shi-Kai as president.
