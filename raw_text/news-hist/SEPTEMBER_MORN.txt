"SEPTEMBER MORN" CONTINUOUS RIOT OF MUSIC AND DANCING

Comedy At Orpheum Is One of Funniest Ever Staged Here; Hilarious Performance Will Be Repeated Tonight.

From the opening chorus to the grand finale, "Star Spangled Banner," "September Morn," the biggest fun festival with tunes and tangoes kept a big audience in a roar of laughter at the Orpheum theatre last night. There is just enough plot in "September Morn" to back up its name and prevent the show from resembling a cabaret program. But there are plenty of good congs, good singers and even better dancers, and altogether the show is one of the best that has come to Bisbee in many moons.

Ruth Wilkins as "Argentina, the World's Greatest Dancer," and William Moore, as "Professor Plastric," walked off the stage with most of the applause, although applause in great chunks was not lacking for anyo f the cast. Miss Wilkins' dancing was graceful, rythmical and thoroughly enjoyable. Moore proved to be about the best "squirrel-food comedian" ever seen cavorting behind local footlights. Billy Murphy's eccentric dancing was as clever as it was ridiculous, and that is saying a good deal, for his every movement resembled that of a lunatic suffering from St. Vitus dance and epileptic fits. The ballroom dances by Leslie Jones and Miss Wilkins were also unusually good.

"September Morn" is just one long joyous riot of fun, music and dancing. There is not a week spot in the cast and if a better musical snow appears in Bisbee this season it will be a surprise to everyone who was at the Orpheum last night. "September Morn" will be repeated tonight. Andâ€”just a suggestion: It would not seem entirely out of the way, during this critical time, if the entire audience would remain standing during the singing of the "Star Spangled Banner," at the close of the show, instead of breaking for the doors in a manner that would indicate that there is little respect for the national anthem in Bisbee.
