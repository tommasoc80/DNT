STORM DAMAGE ALONG THE MIDWAY.

Reckoning After the Tempest Shows Many Dilapidated Tents and Signs.

The Storm of Thursday night was the most severe of the season, according to the automatic instruments at the Weather Bureau exhibit. Rain commenced falling at 8:10 p.m., and between 8:14 and 8:26 one-fifth of an inch fell, being at the rate of 2.50 inches an hour, while from 8:15 to 8:18 it fell at the rate of six inches an hour. At 8:10 the wind blew at the rate of sixty-six miles an hour, while the temperature fell 10Â°.

Considerable damage was done on Midway. At the Indian Village the main tent was blown down and it was not until noon yesterday that it was replaced. The Ferris Wheel kept people in who did not want to go out in the storm and closed the ticket offices, taking those in around twelve times. Two engineers who happened to be in the wheel said they would not take a large sum of money for the experience. At the wheel the weather gauge registered a velocity of sixty-six miles an hour for the wind. The Lapland Village had a great deal of canvas blown away. Forty big stag heads adorned the tent, each with full branching horns, and these fell among the girl performers as the tent went down, but no one was badly bruised. The Laplanders in all the tents were drowned out and had to take refuge in the offices. In Old Vienna some windows were blown in and awnings ruined, but the chief loss was caused by the people who went away in the excitement without paying their bills, it being estimated that the loss was $600.
